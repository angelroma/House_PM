A patient manager written in ASP.NET MVC to help private doctors to manage their patients history. 

# characteristic
I've added a business and a repository layer to improve logic and there is a basic client to test WCF services.
So basically this proyect includes:

* MVC model with 2 extra layers. (Business and Repository layers)
* WCF services for a single table.
* A basic client to test APIs.
* Doctor, Assistant and Admins roles.
* Restrictions and security.
* 3 Tables in SQL server.
* Code-First approach
